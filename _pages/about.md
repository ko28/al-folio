Welcome! I am Minseok Yang, a PhD candidate in Educational Leadership & Policy Analysis at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am on the job market in 2020-2021.

My research and teaching interests include K-12 education policy and leadership, educator labor markets, teachers' unions reform, and quantitative methods for program evaluation. My dissertation project investigates the impact of statewide school reforms aimed at limiting the influence of teachersâ€™ unions on student performance, teacher turnover, and districts' salary policy. In addition to writing policy briefs and reports for policymakers and practitioners, my work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *AERA Open* and *Teaching and Teacher Education*.

A Korean native, I completed a MA in educational administration at Seoul National University and a BA in elementary education at Daegu National University of Education. I taught 2nd, 5th, and 6th grade students in an urban elementary school. Previously, I served as an ROTC officer for 2.5 years. My email is [myang269@wisc.edu](mailto:myang269@wisc.edu)
